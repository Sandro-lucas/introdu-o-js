            <b>Mercury:</b> The closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is the smallest in the Solar System. It has no
            significant
            atmosphere and its surface is marked by large craters.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <b> Venus:</b> Known as the hottest planet in the Solar System, Venus has no traces of life. Its atmosphere
            is
            mainly composed of carbon dioxide, and its surface is covered by thick clouds of sulfuric acid.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <b> Earth:</b> The only known planet to support life, Earth has an atmosphere that allows for the existence
            of
            liquid water. Its surface is composed of continents and oceans.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <b>Mars:</b> Referred to as the "red planet," Mars has a thin atmosphere mainly composed of carbon dioxide.
            Its
            surface features suggest the past existence of water.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <b>Jupiter:</b> The largest planet in the Solar System, Jupiter is a gas giant mainly composed of hydrogen
            and
            helium. It has a ring system and over 70 moons.
        </p>
        <p><br />
            <b>Saturn:</b> Known for its impressive rings, Saturn is another gas giant mainly composed of hydrogen and
            helium.
            It has over 80 moons.
        </p><br />
        <p>
            <b> Uranus:</b> Uranus is a gas giant with an unusual tilt in its axis of rotation, causing it to rotate on
            its
            side. It has rings and at least 27 moons.
        </p><br />
        <p>
            <b> Neptune:</b> The farthest planet in the Solar System, Neptune is a gas giant known for its bluish color.
            rings and 14 known moons.

            <h3> <b>We live inside" the Sun: The Sun's influence extends far beyond its visible surface, creating a
                    region
                    called the heliosphere, where the solar wind has a significant impact on the space environment
                    around
                    the planets</b></h3>

            <br />
            <p>Great Red Spot of Jupiter: Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a massive storm that has been raging for at least
                400
                years. It is so large that it could swallow the Earth whole
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the planets: The Solar System is home to a vast array of objects, including asteroids, comets,
                and
                dwarf
                planets. There are over 552,000 known asteroids and 3,083 comets in the Solar System
            </p>
            <p>
                Spinning in the opposite direction: All the planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in the same
                direction,
                except for Venus, which has a retrograde rotation. This suggests a violent past for the planet
            </p>
            <p>
                The Sun is not where it seems: The Sun is actually orbiting the center of the Milky Way galaxy, along
                with
                the rest of the Solar System. It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit
